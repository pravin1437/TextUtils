# Spam-Ham Classifier Project

This project focuses on building a Spam-Ham Classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm and Count Vectorizer. The classifier is designed to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. 

## Overview

The Spam-Ham Classifier is a machine learning model that analyzes text data to classify messages into one of two categories: spam or ham. It leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is well-suited for text classification tasks. Additionally, it utilizes Count Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Machine Learning libraries (scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: The classifier takes a dataset of labeled messages, where each message is tagged as either spam or ham.
- Outputs: It produces predictions, classifying incoming messages as either spam or ham.

## Main Challenges

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for machine learning is crucial. This includes tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, and handling imbalanced classes.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features from text data is essential for the success of the model. Count Vectorizer converts text data into numerical format, which is compatible with machine learning algorithms.

3. **Model Training**: Choosing the right algorithm and fine-tuning its parameters for optimal performance is a significant challenge.

4. **Evaluation**: Selecting appropriate metrics to assess the model's performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) is critical.

5. **Deployment**: Depending on the project requirements, deploying the model for real-time predictions may be a challenge.
